# Azure Machine Learning
***Docker, VMs, NFS, fuhgetaboutit!***

Azure ML is a cloud-based environment you can use to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track ML models. It supports both code-first and low-code experiences.

Azure ML also has an MLflow-compliant API and UI, so you can use MLflow Tracking and MLflow Models without dealing with hosting the services like this addon does.

Finally, Azure ML's serverless deployment API allows you to manage LLM invocations securely (dump the keys, switch to managed identities like the cool kids!) by hosting the AI Gateway or going further as the entire model hosting story.
